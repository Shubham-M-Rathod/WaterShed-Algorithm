## Lessons Learned

The watershed algorithm is a classic algorithm used for segmentation and is especially useful when extracting touching or overlapping objects in images, such as the coins in the figure above.

Using traditional methods such as thresholding and contour detection, we would be unable to extract each individual entity from the image â€” this is overcome by using the watershed algorithm.
